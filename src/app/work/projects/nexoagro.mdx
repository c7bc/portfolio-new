## Overview

NexoAgro is an operations and telemetry platform for agricultural environments, focused on unifying heterogeneous data (sensor streams, manual field logs, task execution, resource usage) into a coherent spatial + temporal model.  
Core goals:
- Reliable ingestion of IoT & manual inputs
- Geospatial awareness (plots, zones, path traces)
- Time‑series analytics for trends & anomalies
- Task & workflow orchestration (planned recommendations)
- Multi‑tenant isolation with auditable actions
- Foundation for future predictive & advisory modules (yield estimation, input optimization, anomaly detection)

Architecture emphasis: decouple ingestion, normalization, storage, aggregation and insight layers so feature velocity does not compromise data quality or replay capability.

## Key Features

- **Multi‑Source Ingestion Pipeline (Partial)**  
  Supports device pushes (HTTP / webhook), batched CSV uploads, and manual form entries. Planned MQTT or lightweight streaming gateway for near real‑time sensor bursts (soil moisture, temperature, humidity, equipment status).

- **Spatial Modeling & Plot Hierarchy**  
  Entities: Farm → Plot → Zone → Asset (equipment / sensor). Geometry stored with standardized SRID; boundary versions maintained for audit & recalculation of historical metrics.

- **Time‑Series Data Layer**  
  Normalized measurement store (timestamp, source, metric_type, unit, value, geo_ref) enabling clean aggregation; future compression & hypertables (Timescale / partitioned tables) for retention policies.

- **Task & Operations Module**  
  Tasks (scouting, fertilization, irrigation adjustment) linked to zones and assets; lifecycle states (planned → in_progress → completed → verified). Activity feed ties execution to observed sensor context.

- **Resource & Input Tracking (Planned)**  
  Application logs (fertilizer, pesticide, water) with dose/per area metrics; correlation to subsequent sensor trends for effect analysis.

- **Anomaly & Threshold Framework (Planned)**  
  Declarative rule sets (metric > threshold for duration OR delta spike) generating INSIGHT_EVENT records; future ML layer to augment heuristic rules.

- **Offline Sync & Deferred Upload (Planned)**  
  Mobile client queue storing field entries with conflict resolution (last_write_wins + reconciliation log + optional supervisor override).

- **Embeddings / Similarity (Planned)**  
  Vector representation of multi-metric snapshots (soil + weather + recent operations) to surface comparable historical contexts for decision hints.

- **Event Bus & Projection Layer**  
  Internal events: MEASUREMENT_INGESTED, TASK_CREATED, BOUNDARY_UPDATED, THRESHOLD_TRIGGERED enabling projections (dashboards, alert queue, external webhook dispatch).

- **Audit & Traceability**  
  Append-only audit for boundary edits, manual data corrections, task state overrides. Supports future compliance or agronomic certification requirements.

- **Permissions & Multi‑Tenant Security**  
  Organization → member roles (viewer, operator, agronomist, admin) mapped to capability sets (DATA.INGEST, TASK.APPROVE, BOUNDARY.EDIT, EXPORT.RUN).

- **Export & Integrations (Planned)**  
  Scheduled dataset exports (CSV, NDJSON) + aggregated metrics (daily zone summary, cumulative degree days, moisture trend slices) with signed URLs.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend (Go + TypeScript)**: Go ingestion & normalization services; TypeScript (Next.js) dashboard & admin tooling.
- **PostgreSQL (Core Store)**: Relational + spatial (PostGIS planned) + future time‑series partitioning; constraints ensure metric type/unit consistency.
- **Spatial Extensions (Planned)**: PostGIS for geometry operations (area calculations, containment, proximity).
- **Time‑Series Strategy**: Native partitioned tables (date/metric) with partial indexes; optional TimescaleDB or custom retention procedures.
- **Queue / Stream (Planned)**: NATS or Redis Streams for decoupled ingestion → normalization → analytics projection.
- **Redis (Planned)**: Caching of computed zone summaries, hot metric snapshots, rate limiting device bursts.
- **Vector Store (Planned)**: pgvector for similarity over multi-metric feature embeddings.
- **Auth & Security**: JWT / session tokens with capability scoping, potential RLS for strict row isolation under multi-org queries.
- **Observability**: Structured logging, ingestion latency metrics, ingestion failure counters; planned tracing (OpenTelemetry) and metric cardinality pruning.
- **Infrastructure**: Dockerized services, Makefile ops tasks, CI (planned) for migrations + schema drift detection.
- **Validation & Schemas**: JSON schema or Zod (dashboard forms) ensuring consistent measurement and task payload ingestion.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Heterogeneous Data Quality**  
   Devices produce inconsistent units / sampling intervals. Strategy: normalization table + unit canonicalization + rejection log for invalid entries improves downstream reliability.

2. **Spatial Versioning**  
   Changing plot boundaries invalidates historical area-dependent metrics. Introduced boundary version table with effective ranges enabling recalculation without data loss.

3. **Partition Strategy Trade‑Offs**  
   Over‑partitioning increases planning overhead; under‑partitioning inflates large scans. Balanced by grouping partitions monthly per metric category & indexing on (org_id, zone_id, ts).

4. **Schema Evolution vs Velocity**  
   Locking early schema harms feature iteration. Employed migration discipline + lightweight ADRs to capture rationale & enable controlled change.

5. **Event Ordering & Replay**  
   Sensor bursts can arrive out-of-order. Sequence numbers & ingestion_timestamp vs event_timestamp allow reordering logic & late arrival handling.

6. **Task Context Coupling**  
   Embedding too much sensor state in task records bloats storage. Chose indirect linking (task references snapshot ID) enabling rehydration of context on demand.

7. **Anomaly Noise**  
   Pure threshold rules triggered false positives (diurnal moisture swings). Plan: layered approach (smoothing windows + derivative constraints) before ML introduction.

8. **Performance vs Analytical Flexibility**  
   Wide denormalized table tempting for dashboards; chose normalized core + materialized views for heavy aggregates to preserve ingestion speed.

9. **Future Predictive Modules**  
   Avoided premature ML; built feature extraction pipeline (windowed aggregates, lag features) so experimentation can start without major refactors.

10. **Offline Reliability (Planned)**  
    Conflict scenarios defined early (duplicate manual entries, delayed uploads) preventing ambiguous merges later in mobile client development.

## Outcome

Current state (in development):
- Core relational schema (farms, plots, zones, assets, measurements, tasks, audit events) established.
- Ingestion API & normalization pass for basic metrics operational.
- Boundary versioning & audit scaffold implemented.
- Event stubs (MEASUREMENT_INGESTED, TASK_CREATED) emitting; projection layer draft.
- Dashboard early views: zone listing, metric sparkline prototypes, task lifecycle basics.
- Observability baseline (structured logs + latency timers); failure classification enumerated.

Upcoming milestones:
- PostGIS integration & spatial queries (containment / overlap checks).
- Partition strategy refinement & retention policy automation.
- Threshold engine & anomaly event emission.
- Offline sync queue definition & mobile client spec.
- Embeddings + vector similarity prototype for contextual advisories.
- Materialized analytical views (daily zone summary, cumulative metrics).
- Export scheduler & webhook delivery reliability.

NexoAgro is not publicly launched; emphasis is on data correctness, extensible domain boundaries and operational clarity before predictive layers and external tenants.

*Status*: Ongoing — iterative hardening prior to public pilot.
