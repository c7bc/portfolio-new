## Overview

Infinity Boost is an MVP multi‑game marketplace unifying sale and fulfillment of:
- Digital goods (accounts, currencies, items, top‑ups)
- Structured & custom boosting (service requests with multi‑booster offers)

The architecture is designed for high domain variability: each game category (initial: Roblox, Rocket League) toggles which offer modes are enabled and injects its own validation schema, enumerations, metadata fields, delivery semantics, pricing constraints and service lifecycles.

Boosting introduces an inverted marketplace flow (buyer posts a request → boosters submit offers → buyer accepts one). Non‑boosting goods follow a direct order purchase flow. Core emphasis: correctness of lifecycle state machines, auditability, fraud risk mitigation and future extensibility (additional games, price intelligence, ranking, KYC).

## Key Features

- **Category Feature Flagging**  
  Category model enumerates enabled offer modes: currency_enabled, accounts_enabled, topups_enabled, items_enabled, boosting_enabled. Drives dynamic form generation & validation activation.

- **Offer Modes (Product Archetypes)**  
  1. Currency: unit‑based pricing (price_per_unit), min quantity, stock, delivery window + guaranteed window, optional device/platform dimension (platform required for RL credits, not Roblox).  
  2. Accounts: fixed price, optional instant delivery payload (credential bundle), structured metadata (platform, security hints), potential batch listing (future).  
  3. Top Ups: enumeration of rigid tier amounts per category (Roblox: 400, 800, 1700…; RL: 500, 1100, 3000…), platform requirement where applicable. Fulfillment = credited service action with SLA.  
  4. Items: similar to Accounts (fixed price + optional instant delivery) but semantic field set (rarity, category, cosmetic type).  
  5. Boosting: inverted request/offer negotiation with structured or custom schemas (Roblox + RL specific variants).

- **Boosting Request Variants**  
  - Roblox (examples): Grow a Garden, Blox Fruits, Steal a Brainrot, Adopt Me, Blade Ball, Custom Request (requires game_name + request_description). Mode flags: stream / offline.  
  - Rocket League: Rank Boost (current_rank → desired_rank; enforced monotonic progression), Placement Boost, Net Wins (count), Tournament Boost (games count), Custom Request. Shared customization flags: stream, solo_queue, offline_mode, duo.

- **Offer Lifecycle (Non‑Boosting)**  
  Offer published → Buyer order created (pending payment / verification) → Escrow lock (planned) → Fulfillment (auto delivery or manual mark) → Confirmation → Settlement / auto‑release or dispute.

- **Boosting Request Lifecycle**  
  Request created (pending) → Broadcast to subscribed boosters → Offers collected → Buyer accepts one (request => in_progress; others declined / left pending per policy) → Completion (await confirmation) → Closed / disputed / expired (TTL auto‑cancel).

- **Escrow & Dispute Framework (Planned)**  
  Escrow ledger entries tied to order_id; dispute state overlays lock release. Dispute actions audited (evidence submission, moderator resolution).

- **Notification & Subscription Model**  
  Booster subscription table: categories + boosting variants → queued notifications (future push / email). Event emission on new request aligns with subscription filters.

- **Audit & Compliance Logging**  
  Append trail for sensitive transitions: order state changes, credential delivery, dispute decisions, booster acceptance, admin overrides.

- **Risk & Anti‑Abuse (Foundational)**  
  Rate limits (request creation, offer spam), duplicate credential hash detection, suspicious pricing thresholds (under/over median), future device fingerprint hooks.

- **Role & Permission Model**  
  Roles: buyer, seller, booster, moderator, admin. Capability mapping (ORDER.DISPUTE.RESOLVE, REQUEST.ACCEPT, OFFER.SUBMIT) prevents conditional scattering.

- **Structured Validation Layer**  
  Domain validators enforce enumerations (rank sets, platform sets, delivery durations), numeric ranges (wins 1..5, placement games 1..10), monotonic rank progression, presence of required custom fields.

- **Expiration & TTL Policies**  
  Boosting requests, booster offers, unconfirmed deliveries, payment reservations tracked with expiration_time, background sweeper transitions stale states (pending → expired / cancelled).

- **Future Intelligence Hooks (Planned)**  
  Price suggestion engine (rank delta heuristics), booster quality scoring (completion ratio, average delivery variance), dynamic SLA warnings.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend (Go)**: Clean architecture layers: domain (entities, invariants), application (use cases), interface (HTTP handlers), infra (repos, queues).  
- **Go Concurrency Patterns**: Worker pools for expiration sweeps & notification dispatch. Context cancellation for long operations.  
- **Data Store (PostgreSQL)**: Core relational schemas (categories, offers, requests, orders, offers_boosting, disputes, escrow_ledger, audit_events). Foreign key constraints + check constraints for enumerated sets (delivery_duration enum).  
- **ORM / Query**: Direct SQL + optional lightweight mapper; transactional wrappers for multi‑step state transitions.  
- **Queue (Planned)**: Redis Streams or NATS for async notifications, dispute workflow tasks, expiration events.  
- **Caching (Planned)**: Redis for hot median price snapshots, booster subscription filters, rate limit counters.  
- **HTTP Layer**: RESTful endpoints with version prefix; planned internal admin endpoints separated by capability layer.  
- **Validation**: Central schema validators (rank sets, durations, numeric bounds) + compound validations (desired_rank > current_rank).  
- **Observability**: Structured logs (zerolog), correlation/request IDs, baseline metrics (request rate, state transition counts, dispute ratio). Future tracing (OpenTelemetry) & p95 latency dashboards.  
- **Security**: JWT tokens with role & capability claims, HMAC signing for sensitive webhooks (future), password hashing (Argon2/Bcrypt), rate limiting (token bucket).  
- **Delivery Payload Handling**: Encrypted at rest (planned) for account credentials; auto delivery triggers event chain (CREDENTIAL_PUSHED).  
- **CI/CD (Planned)**: Static analysis, unit + integration tests (state transitions), migration drift detection, container build & vulnerability scan.  
- **Infrastructure**: Docker dev environment, Makefile task orchestration, environment segregation (dev / staging / prod).  

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Domain Variability Without Explosion**  
   Approach: category feature flags + pluggable validation strategy per offer mode rather than branching logic everywhere. Reduces code churn when adding a new game.

2. **Boosting Schema Complexity**  
   Rank progression & variant‑specific params risk ad hoc checks. Formalized variant schema registry with typed validators and monotonic assertions.

3. **State Machine Integrity**  
   Orders & requests risk illegal jumps (e.g., confirm before fulfillment). Solution: centralized transition service enforcing permitted (current_state, action) pairs + audit emission.

4. **Preventing Offer Spam**  
   Boosters spamming trivial offers dilutes buyer experience. Rate limit window + duplicate (price, delivery_estimate) suppression + future scoring weight.

5. **Dispute / Escrow Timing**  
   Escrow release race conditions if seller submission & dispute open near-simultaneous. Introduced atomic escrow_finalize guard & double‑check of dispute state.

6. **Expiration Scalability**  
   Naive periodic sweep of all pending entries is wasteful. Batched cursor scanning on indexed expiration_time pre-filter ensures predictable overhead.

7. **Validation Drift**  
   Enums evolving (delivery durations, rank sets) risk stale clients. Plan: client metadata endpoint (capabilities + enumerations) enabling dynamic UI generation & reducing redeploy friction.

8. **Credential Security**  
   Storing plaintext is unacceptable. Designed encryption boundary + one‑time revelation pattern (future), logging only hashed envelope IDs to avoid leak.

9. **Pricing Outliers**  
   Underpriced malicious offers distort trust. Introduced median snapshot + threshold factor; outliers flagged (not rejected yet) for future risk scoring.

10. **Abstraction Discipline**  
    Resisted premature microservice split (escrow, disputes, boosting engine) to retain iteration velocity. Clear internal package boundaries preserve future extraction path.

## Outcome

Current MVP status (near launch):
- Core schemas, migrations & primary enums in place.
- Offer & order lifecycle flows implemented with transition integrity checks.
- Boosting request creation, booster offer submission & acceptance path operational.
- Structured validation engine (rank progression, enumerations, ranges) active.
- Audit event emission for critical transitions established.
- Rate limiting + basic anti‑spam rules integrated.
- Initial notification broadcast (in‑process) working; external queue planned.
- Dispute & escrow scaffolding (schemas + interfaces) defined; business logic partially implemented.
- Observability baseline: structured logs, key counters, error taxonomy.

Next milestones:
- Escrow balancing + secure release triggers.
- Dispute resolution workflow (evidence attachments, moderator decision model).
- Notification queue extraction & retry semantics.
- Credential encryption & one‑time access pipeline.
- Median price cache + risk flag surfacing in UI.
- Webhooks for state changes (order.completed, request.accepted).
- Performance profiling & load test for boosting offer storms.

Infinity Boost is close to first public pilot; focus is hardening escrow & dispute safety, finalizing boosting reliability, and tightening validation transparency.
