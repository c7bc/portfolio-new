## Overview

LibertyCoin is a Web3 operations dashboard providing a unified interface for:
- Connecting EVM wallets (MetaMask / WalletConnect)
- Aggregating multi‑token balances & fiat equivalents
- Executing contract method calls (read/write) with guardrails
- Tracking real‑time transaction status & gas metrics
- Managing a lightweight admin panel for token distribution campaigns

Project scope: rapid MVP → production hardening in a freelance engagement. I owned product discovery translation, Figma system design, frontend implementation (Next.js + SSR routes), backend API (Express + provider adapters), and integration QA with test networks (Goerli / Sepolia or client‑specified testnets).

## Key Features

- **Wallet Connection Layer**  
  Unified connect component (MetaMask injection, WalletConnect) with network mismatch detection and chain switching prompt.

- **Token Balance Aggregation**  
  Batched RPC calls (eth_call multicall) for ERC‑20 balanceOf + decimals + symbol; fiat conversion pipeline via external price API (coalesced rate caching).

- **Transaction Lifecycle Tracking**  
  Pending → mined → confirmed (N blocks) status streaming with exponential backoff and baseline latency measurement; user notifications on status change.

- **Contract Interaction Console**  
  Whitelisted contract ABI methods (read + selected write). Form auto‑generates inputs with type validation (uint, address, bytes). Gas estimate preview + manual override.

- **Portfolio Snapshot & History**  
  Periodic snapshot table (timestamp, token, balance, fiat_estimate) enabling delta charts; transaction history enriched with function signature decoding.

- **Admin Token Distribution (Airdrop Tool)**  
  CSV upload (address, amount) → validation (dup, format, allowance) → batched transaction execution or merkle-based claim list generation (planned / optional deliverable stub).

- **Role & Permission Hooks**  
  Basic admin flag gating distribution routes; future expansion stub for multi‑role.

- **Design System (Figma → Code)**  
  Typography scale, color tokens (light/dark), spacing, button & input primitives; exported token file consumed in styled components / Tailwind layer (project used hybrid approach).

- **Error & Revert Surface**  
  Rich error parsing (revert reason decoding) surfaced inline to reduce opaque “transaction failed” UX.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App / Pages Hybrid)**: SEO‑friendly marketing + authenticated dashboard, dynamic routes for /tx/[hash], SSR prefetch of token metadata.
- **Express API**: Auth token verification, proxy to JSON‑RPC providers, rate limiting, signature verification endpoints.
- **Web3 / Ethers.js**: Provider abstraction, contract interface generation, multicall batching.
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing across client + server; shared DTOs & ABI method signatures.
- **Redis (Optional / Deployed if enabled)**: Price cache, recent tx lookups, rate limiter counters.
- **PostgreSQL (Light Persistence)**: Users, session tokens, portfolio snapshots, admin job audit logs.
- **Figma**: Component library, auto‑layout patterns, semantic token sheet → exported JSON.
- **Zod**: Validation for contract write parameters and admin CSV ingestion.
- **Wagmi / WalletConnect (if allowed)**: Simplified wallet flows (abstracted behind custom hook).

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **RPC Rate & Latency Variance**  
   Mitigated by batching multicall + fallback to secondary provider; reduced cold load token balance latency.

2. **Gas Estimation Accuracy**  
   Edge cases (dynamic fee spikes) required re‑estimation right before user confirmation; added “freshness window” for gas preview.

3. **ABI Surface Explosion**  
   Avoided exposing full arbitrary write access; curated allowlist with metadata (safe / requires caution). Prevented misuse and revert spam.

4. **Balance Snapshot Consistency**  
   Race between snapshot job and user triggered refresh; introduced snapshot_version and “latest stable” flag.

5. **Fiat Conversion Drift**  
   Coalescing requests to price API every N seconds reduced jitter; moved conversion to server to avoid leaking API key.

6. **Revert Reason UX**  
   Many raw errors unreadable. Added error decoder mapping common reason signatures → friendly messages.

7. **Airdrop Validation at Scale**  
   Large CSV rows caused blocking processing; streamed parse + incremental validation with early rejection summary.

8. **Security Considerations**  
   Prevented arbitrary contract calls by scoping ABIs; sanitized user-provided addresses, enforced checksummed formatting.

## Outcome

Delivered:  
- Production‑ready MVP (wallet connect, token balances, transactions, interaction console).  
- Admin airdrop scaffold + CSV validation workflow.  
- Figma design system aligned with implemented token set.  
- Observability baseline (structured logs + error taxonomy + RPC latency metrics).  

Result: Faster manual ops replacement and reduced user friction performing routine token checks & contract interactions.

*Status*: Delivered; minor enhancements & extended airdrop (Merkle claim mode) under consideration.

## (Optional) Future Enhancements

- Merkle airdrop builder with proof export  
- Multi-chain portfolio aggregation (chain registry)  
- Subscription push (pending → confirmed tx) via WebSocket  
- Advanced risk flags (low liquidity token detection)
