## Overview

Vettano is a real‑time multiplayer drawing & guessing ecosystem engineered for global traffic, low latency, and extensibility. It unifies:
- Multiple structured game modes (Classic, Competitive, Instant, Typing, Free)
- A configurable room system (official vs. user‑created, public/private)
- A hierarchical role and permission architecture (User, Moderator, Administrator, Superadmin)
- Thematic curation (official & user themes with moderation workflow)
- Persistent audit logs for transparency, moderation, and future compliance
- A future service split: static/core API + dynamic real‑time services (rooms, chat, scoring, events)

The platform is being built with a “core first” approach: domain modeling, isolation boundaries, observability hooks and secure data design precede feature fan‑out.

## Key Features

- **Room & Session Orchestration (Planned + Partial)**  
  Canonical REST API for creation, configuration, listing and lifecycle state of rooms (capacity, modes, regional preferences, language, privacy flags). Future real‑time dispatcher will shard players across regional nodes.

- **Multi Game Modes (Extensible Engine)**  
  Classic & Competitive with structured rounds; Instant & Typing with reduced rules; Free Mode for unconstrained creative sessions. Engine abstractions separate: turn progression, scoring policy, time budget, and artifact persistence.

- **Role & Permission Hierarchy**  
  User (custom themes & rooms) → Moderator (official theme creation/edit within quotas) → Administrator (full content & disciplinary controls) → Superadmin (platform governance). Permissions mapped to capability sets rather than hard‑coded switches.

- **Theme Management & Moderation Pipeline**  
  Official vs. user‑generated themes with submission states: draft → pending review → approved/rejected. Moderation logs + action provenance stored for auditability.

- **Audit & Action Logging**  
  Structured immutable append (planned WORM pattern) for: bans, room config changes, theme approvals, role escalations, critical system mutations.

- **Player Safety & Anti‑Abuse (In Progress)**  
  Offensive content flagging (manual now → future ML heuristics), rate limiting for chat/events, ban & temporary suspension model, escalation thresholds.

- **Scoring & Ranking Core**  
  Score progression modularized per mode. Future: normalized elo‑like ranking service with season rotations and outlier detection for anomalous boosts.

- **Internationalization & Regional Awareness**  
  Region attribute at room + planned latency probing to direct players to nearest real‑time cluster; language tags for discoverability.

- **Extensible Event Bus (Planned)**  
  Internal event types: ROOM_CREATED, THEME_PUBLISHED, ROLE_CHANGED, PLAYER_BANNED → enabling projections (analytics, feed, notifications).

- **Data Integrity & Recovery**  
  Soft deletes + archival strategy for recoverable entities (themes, rooms) with future point‑in‑time restore for administrative reversals.

- **Design for Future Microservices**  
  Start as a modular monolith exposing clean domain packages (themes, rooms, auth, roles) → selective extraction: scoring service, moderation engine, notification dispatcher.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend Core (Go)**: Domain‑driven modular packages, HTTP handlers (chi / net/http pattern), planned gRPC façade for real‑time edge services.
- **TypeScript (Support / Tooling)**: SDK & admin panel integration; future internal CLI for migrations & seeding.
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary datastore; row‑level security strategy (planned for multi‑tenant or segmented admin zones), composite indexes for room + status + region queries, enum domains for mode/state.
- **Redis (Planned)**: Ephemeral state (room presence, matchmaking queue candidates, rate limiter counters).
- **WebSockets (Planned Real‑Time Layer)**: Event broadcasting per room channel + ephemeral state diffs.
- **Message Queue (Planned)**: NATS or Redis Streams for cross‑service event propagation & reliable moderation tasks.
- **Observability (Baseline)**: Structured logging (zerolog), correlation IDs, planned OpenTelemetry traces + metrics (latency p95, join/leave throughput, error budgets).
- **Security Layers**: JWT or session tokens (rotatable), scoped capability checks, rate limiting (token bucket), input normalization & validation.
- **Tooling**: Makefile scripts, Docker for environments, future Terragrunt/IaC for infrastructure codification.
- **CI/CD (Planned)**: Lint + unit + contract test pipeline, container security scanning, migration drift detection.

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Balancing Early Scope vs. Core Integrity**  
   Avoiding premature microservices by enforcing clear domain boundaries inside a single codebase first. This reduces cognitive overhead while preserving future extraction paths.

2. **Role & Permission Explosion**  
   Naive role checks quickly become scattered. Solution: capability registry + mapping table; roles are curated sets of capabilities (THEME.CREATE.OFFICIAL, ROOM.BAN.USER, etc.).

3. **Theme Moderation Workflow**  
   Need for explicit state machine (draft → pending → approved → deprecated). Simplifies UI logic and prevents half‑approved inconsistent state.

4. **Future Real‑Time Performance**  
   Designing APIs with future WebSocket amplification in mind (room membership queries are index‑friendly; payload shapes stable). Minimizes refactors when the dynamic service launches.

5. **Audit Trail Design**  
   Logging alone insufficient — need structured, append-only semantics, actor + target + reason + contextual hash for tamper resistance (future immutable storage or hash chain).

6. **Extensibility of Game Modes**  
   Mode differences isolated behind an interface: PhaseController, ScorePolicy, TimerProfile. This prevents conditional bloat across handlers.

7. **Preventing Over‑Engineering**  
   Using “just enough” abstraction; deferring ML classification, advanced ranking and event sourcing until baseline usage validates complexity.

## Outcome

Vettano is actively in development:  
- Core domain models (rooms, themes, roles, audit events) defined.  
- REST foundation & permission mapping patterns established.  
- Observability baseline + indexing strategy drafted.  
Next milestones: real‑time session service, moderation workflow enforcement, persistent scoring engine, and player safety expansion.  
Even pre‑launch, the architecture positions Vettano for scalable multi‑mode growth with operational transparency and extensibility.
